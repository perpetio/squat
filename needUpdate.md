# Hi there
I just find the web of Perpetio and see this project 
call 'How to Build an Image Recognition App with AI and Machine Learning' on this URL 

[https://perpet.io/blog/how-to-build-an-image-recognition-app-a-step-by-step-tutorial-and-use-cases-examples/]

The thing is that when I start to built the project in Android Studio arises some problems with the graddle thing, also there's some issues concernig to the Kotlin Plug in, can you help me to update the repository please, I'm a begginner on Android Development but I want to run this amazing project, I'm a Student by the way. Please give me a hand with this.
